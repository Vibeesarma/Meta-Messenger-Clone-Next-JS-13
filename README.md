## Redis 
Please Keep in mind 
- When setup redis url don't forgot to put 'rediss' in env

## SWR

* 
  const { data, error, mutate } = useSWR("/api/getMessages", fetcher);

  - 
 in here what value you put on first argument it does not a meter it just a key to get that message data from cache you can put any instead of 'api/getMessages'

* 
await mutate(uploadMessageToUpstash, {
      optimisticData: [message, ...messages!],
      rollbackOnError: true,
    });

-  this is a function for get from cache file in swr you add function what will same as optimistic data then only you can get data from cache
